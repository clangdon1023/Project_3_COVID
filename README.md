Project Proposal
Show the effects/spread of COVID-19 from 01/22/2020 - 07/27/2020

Create 3 Unique Views of the Data
 * Filter by Continent, drill down to country
    - World Map View of cases per country
 * Roll-up total of deaths
 * Sliding scale of spread over time
    - Have a bubble shape over the map to show the spread
 * Narrow down to US visuals since that has the most data

  * Dashboard page with multiple charts that all reference the same data (Leaflet)
  * House the data in a SQL database
  * Create a Python Flask API
  * Includes a HTML/CSS
