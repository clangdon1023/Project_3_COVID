# Project_3_COVID



Project Proposal

Show the effects/spread of COVID-19 from 01/22/2020 - 07/27/2020

Create 3 Unique Views of the Data
 * Filter by Continent, drill down to country
    - World Map View of cases per country
 * Roll-up total of deaths
 * Sliding scale of spread over time
    - Have a bubble shape over the map to show the spread
 * Narrow down to US visuals since that has the most data

Requirements

  * Dashboard page with multiple charts that all reference the same data (Leaflet)
  * JavaScript Library not covered in class
  * House the data in a SQLite database
  * Create a Python Flask API
  * Includes a HTML/CSS
  * JavaScript
    

    This project was created to emphasize the importance of data keeping and organizing data for analysis. It also allowed us to learn and utilize different language platforms to merge data and create meaningful charts that interact with with the viewer making analyzation more understandable. With enough data, you can analyze different patterns and fluctuations in numbers. Included in this repository is COVID-19 data showing # of deaths, # of confirmed cases, and countries it affected from 1/22/2020-7/27/2020. The data was pulled from Kaggle into CSV files. These were then imported into Python, SQLite and then flask to create different graphs to show worldwide data collected through the pandemic. 


Instructions to Open Files:

    *Download the file "Project_3_COVID" and git clone it to your desktop using your Gitbash(windows)/Terminal(mac).
    
    *Change Directory "cd" until you get to the file "Flask"
    
    *Run terminal/bash from "app.py"
    
    *After this runs, there will be an http web browser. Copy that and paste it into Google Chrome/Safari.
    
    *This will open up the flask program showing the the interactive dashboard.


Once the file is open, there is a drop down menu with dates ranging from 1/22/2020-7/27/2020. You can select any of these dates and see the graphs change between each selection.
